Introduction
------------
This framework was created based on nearly 25 years of software development experience, with the goal of solving
common and recurring problems found across many companies and projects, such as:

- Lack of coding standards and reuse
- Excessive complexity and duplication
- Environment-specific code versions
- Hard-coded persistence, controllers, and business logic
- Poor or overly complex UI solutions
- Bloated dependency trees
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing centralized utilities

The result is a simple, standardized, secure, and reliable framework that accelerates development while maintaining
high code quality, following these core goals:

- Enforce standards and best practices
- Promote code reuse and modularity
- Simplify environment management
- Decouple persistence, business, and integration layers
- Reduce dependencies and attack surface
- Improve maintainability, security, and scalability
