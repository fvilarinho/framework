Synopsis
========
The main goal of this framework is to provide a simple, reliable and standardized way to develop Web Applications.
The development was started in 2006 and since then new features and improvements are being released constantly.

Motivation
==========
In my nearly 25 years of experience in software development, I faced the same problems in different companies and 
projects such as:

1. Code with lack of standards, reuse and complexity generating duplications.
2. Different versions for different environments (Operating systems, Development, Production, etc).
3. Hard-coded and/or non synchronized persistence layer within data models.
4. Hard-coded and/or non synchronized integration layer within business layer.
5. Poor and/or non-customizable UI.
6. A lot of unused libraries in the dependency tree.
7. Critical security flaws/vulnerabilities.
8. Lack of a centralized utilities package.

This framework was designed to address these problems during the development process. As a result, it ensures faster and
more reliable deliveries.
