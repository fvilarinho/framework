Introduction
---
This framework was created based on nearly **25 years of software development experience**, with the goal of solving 
common and recurring problems found across many companies and projects, such as:

- Lack of coding standards and reuse
- Excessive complexity and duplication
- Environment-specific code versions
- Hard-coded persistence, controllers, and business logic
- Poor or overly complex UI solutions
- Bloated dependency trees
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing centralized utilities

The result is a **simple, standardized, secure, and reliable framework** that accelerates development while maintaining 
high code quality, following these core goals:

- ✅ Enforce **standards and best practices**
- ✅ Promote **code reuse and modularity**
- ✅ Simplify **environment management**
- ✅ Decouple **persistence, business, and integration layers**
- ✅ Reduce **dependencies and attack surface**
- ✅ Improve **maintainability, security, and scalability**
